# math

Notes from Scott Druker's calculus classes. Written in a combination of Markdown, HTML, and LaTeX.

## ðŸš§ TODOs
- [ ] Convert notes from both first and second semester
- [ ] Classify notes into sections outlined in this document
- [ ] Unify image designs (import from a semi-consistent source, such as Wikimedia) <-- this is going to be ga
- [ ] Make "Learning Targets" collapsed by default
