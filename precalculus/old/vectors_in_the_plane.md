# Vectors in the Plane

## Learning Targets

You should be able to

- Write 2D vector and find unit vector and magnitude
- Perform operations of vectors
- Solve applications including force and direction of objects

## Concepts / Definitions

A _two dimensional vector_ is an ordered pair of real numbers,
denoted in component form as $\vec{v} = \langle a, b\rangle$.
The numbers $a$ and $b$ and the components. If an arrow has initial
point $A(x_1, y_1)$ and terminal point $(x_2, y_2)$, it represents
the vector in component form $\vec{AB} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1\rangle$

## Magnitude

[Image]

The magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is the length of the arrow and the
direction of $\vec{v}$ iis the direction in which the arrow is pointing.

[Image]

The _magnitude of vector_ $\vec{v} = \langle v_1, v_2\rangle$, represented by
$\vec{AB}$ is $|v| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(v_1)^2 + (v_2)^2}$

## Unit Vector

[Image]

The _unit vector_ $\vec{u}$ is a vector with length $|u| = 1$.

$$\vec{u} = \frac{1}{|v|}\vec{v}$$

## Linear combination of a vector (_ij_ form)

[Image]

Two component unit vectors are represented by ($\hat{i}$ hat and $\hat{j}$ hat).
$\hat{i} = \langle 1, 0 \rangle$ and $\hat{j} = \langle 0, 1 \rangle$.

The linear combination of a vector
$\vec{v}$ is $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle = ai + bj$

## Operations (answer is called resultant)

The sum or difference of vectors $\vec{a} \pm \vec{b}$ is $\vec{a} \pm \vec{b} = \langle a_1 \pm b_1, a_2 \pm b_2 \rangle$

The product of the scalar k and the vector $\vec{v}$ is $k\vec{a} = \langle ka_1, ka_2 \rangle$

## Trigonometric form and direction angle of vectors

[Image]

If $\vec{v}$ has direction angle $\theta$, the components of $\vec{v}$ can be computed
$\vec{v} = \langle |v|\;cos\;\theta, |v|\;sin\;\theta \rangle$

and the unit vector in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is $\vec{u} = \langle cos\;\theta, sin\;\theta \rangle$

## Application

Weight force, $F_{g}$ directly downward, can be calculated by multiplying the mass by the acceleration.
