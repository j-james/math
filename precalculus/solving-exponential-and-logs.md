# Solving Exponential and Logs

## Learning Targets

You should be able to
- [ ] Solve simple exponential and log equations

## Concepts / Definitions

Follow the rules of SADME for one variable.

### Solving Exponential

$$b^x = a$$
$$\log_{b}{b^x} = \log_{b}{a}$$
$$x = \log_{b}{a}$$

### Solving Logarithmic

$$\log_{b}{x} = a$$
$$b^{\log_{b}{x}} = b^a$$
$$x = b^a$$
