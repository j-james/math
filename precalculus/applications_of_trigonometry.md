# Applications of Trigonometry - Review

## 2D Vectors:
- Forms: component, linear comb., or trig
- Find magnitude
- Angle between vectors
- Write unit vector, other magnitude
- Write perpendicular vector
- Perform operations
- Dot product
- Projection vectors
- Applications:
    - Force
    - Box on ramp
    - Work (force $$*$$ distance)
    - Bearing (ship/plane)
    - Tension

**Example:** An airplane is flying on a bearing of 285° at 480 mph. 
A wind is blowing with the bearing 265° at 30 mph. 
Find the actual speed and bearing direction of the plane. 

## Trigonometric Form of a Complex Number:
- Write $$z = a + bi$$ into $$z = r cis \theta$$
- Find product and quotient of $$z$$ in trig form 
  $$z_{1}z_{2} = r_{1}r_{2}cis(\theta_{1} + \theta_{2})$$, $$z_{1}/z_{2} = r_{1}/r_{2} cis(\theta_{1} -  \theta_{2})$$
- Find powers (DeMoivre's Theorem) and roots of z
  $$z^n = r^n cis(n\theta)$$
  $$formula$$

**Example:** The ___ root of what complex number, $$z = a + bi$$ is shown below? (answers $z_{k=0}$ to $z_{k=5}$)
